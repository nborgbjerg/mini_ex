**The Generative Raven**

I collaborated with *Camilla* from my study group.

**Our program** takes a verse from the well-known poem *The Raven* by English poet Edgar Allan Poe. The poem is quite eerie and is a story of a man slowly falling into madness. The poem in itself keeps a rhythm throughout it's entirety, where every stressed syllable is followed by an unstressed syllable. This would've been good to have been read out loud, which I will speak further off in the analysis.
We agreed upon this program, because we liked the idea of *poem-generator* much like ones we've seen in class and other places on the internet. The program replaces most of the verbs, nouns, adjectives and pronouns every time you press the mouse button. We decided to keep some words there, to give the verse some identificators and it works kinda like a [mad libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs).

Upon start-up a *computer-voice* reads "*The Raven,*" which is the title of the original poem and the original verse shows up on screen. We would've liked it to read up all the different titles for each generated poem, but we couldn't get it to work with the randomization for some reason, even tried putting some of it in a .json file, but we had to acknowledge that we were defeated and it was beyond our power.

**The aesthetic aspects in particular to the relationship between code and language**

First of all we wanted the program to get that dark, mysterious feel to it by adding the sound of a raven in the background while dark clouds/fog floated in the background. Here we took inspiration from an older work by [Nynne](https://nynnelucca.github.io/Mini-exercises/Mini_ex5/empty-example/).

We picked poems as our language part in the program. Poems have a rhythm  to them, and most of the have rules implied as well. This can be rhyme, tempo, rhythm, number of lines and generally how each stanza is build. Language has rules on its own, so poems/poetry is adding a second layer of rules. Putting it all into a code, we almost add a third layer of rules to the program. As said in *Vocable Code*
