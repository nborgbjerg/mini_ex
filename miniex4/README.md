My program captures the video of the webcam and mic input. For the video capture I used the createCapture syntax, but it wasn't possible to put a filter on top of a capture, I had to make it an image. For that I used the simple *image* syntax and used the capture variable so that I could put the *blur* filter on top of it, and then hid the actualy capture that would otherwise be on top of the image.
For capturing the audio I used a variable and the p5.AudioIn, so that it would capture the audio from the microphone. The blurring of the image is set on a value between 0 and 5, 5 being the most blurred. I had to convert the input from the mic unto this. For that I used the map syntax. First I used it to sort of spread out the range of audio, which is normally 0 to 1, and made it 0 to 100. With the variable *threshold* I then converted the mic input into a range from 0 to 5 and put that as the value of the blur. I had to put it as 5 to 0, so that it would unblur as the volume went up.

At first I wanted the image of the capture to be pixelated and then get "un-pixelated" as the volume went up. I downloaded a pixelation library but could't get it to work, so I settled with the blur filter which I am quite happy with in the end. The idea behind the program came from my eternal frustration over people who argue on Facebook and other internet forums. The internet is a place where everybody is watching you, hence why I put the *recording* interface on the program. There is a tendency for people to be very upfront and controversial online, often to a degree that they would not be in the real world. Sadly, it is often the loudest people who get heard by the masses. Even though they might be a part of a minority sharing that particular opinion, because they type it out in all caps whenver they see an opportunity, they are the ones that catch the attention. That idea I put into the program, so the louder you yell, the clearer you become.

This exercise taught me how easy it is to capture someones data. It wasn't something that I was unfamiliar with, having seen how website etc. get private information without me knowing. An example is once I texted a friend over Facebook Messenger that I wanted to go to a certain restaurant and moments later ads from that restaurant popped up not only on my Facebook, but on my Instagram as well. You leave traces behind pretty much everywhere you go on the internet. Companies are able to retrieve data from you fairly easily. On most sites you'd have to allow the website to capture your webcam, mic and so forth, but it is incredible how easy it is to access that through a simple website. And god only knows what Terms and Services you agree to when you sign up for different things on the internet. Not only in regard to advertisement, but also hackers are becoming more skilled and a lot of people seem to become less careful when using the internet and their computer in general. 
I also think it was interesting to read about the *Like Economy* and how likes suddenly become currency in a way. When you see a page on Facebook you would often look at the amount of likes as a new [Trustpilot](https://dk.trustpilot.com/). The more likes, the better the company, right? Again, whatever we like will affect all the other things we see online. Facebook and Twitter are linked via social plug-ins on several websites, and from this exercise I can see how easily it is to capture how many people click these buttons. Everything we do online has consequences.
